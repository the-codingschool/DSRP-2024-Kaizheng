## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup, include = false, message = false}
libs <- c("MASS", "sf", "tidyr", "dplyr", "lubridate", "ggplot2",
          "caTools", "scales", "ggpubr", "gridExtra", "cowplot", "ggpmisc")
for (lib in libs) {
  if (!require(lib, character.only = TRUE))
    install.packages(lib, character.only = TRUE)
  library(lib, character.only = TRUE)
}
library(stringr)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
