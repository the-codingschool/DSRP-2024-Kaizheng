# Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis-SF Traffic

## Preparation

### Import All Necessary Packages

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(titanic)
library(tidyr) 
library(tidyverse) 
library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2) 
library(readr)
```

### Reading in Data

```{r}
#Define url of data
url <- 'C:\\Users\\bluep\\Downloads\\clean_traffic_data.csv'

# Load the dataset into a dataframe called traffic_d8ata
clean_traffic_data <- read_csv(url)
print(clean_traffic_data)
```

## Basic Exploration

### Unique values in columns of interest

**collision_severity (5)**: Injury (Complaint of Pain), Injury (Other Visible), Fatal, Injury (Severe), Medical

**move_pre_acc (20+NA) \[movement before collision\]**: Proceeding Straight, Entering Traffic, Slowing/Stopping, Stopped, Traveling Wrong Way, Making Right Turn, Making Left Turn, Parked, NA, Changing Lanes, Making U Turn, Passing Other Vehicle, Backing, Other, Parking Maneuver, Ran Off Road, Other Unsafe Turning, Crossed Into Opposing Lane, Merging, Crossing Into Opposing Lane

**type_of_collision (8+NA)**: Sideswipe, NA, Other, Vehicle/Pedestrian, Broadside, Rear End, Head-On, Hit Object, Overturned

**mviw \[motor vehicle involved with\] (10+NA)**: Parked Motor Vehicle, NA, Non-Collision, Pedestrian, Other Motor Vehicle, Bicycle, Fixed Object, Other Object, Motor Vehicle on Other Roadway, Train, Animal

**ped_action (7+NA)**: Pedestrian Involved; Crossing Not in Crosswalk; Crossing in Crosswalk at Intersection; In Road, Including Shoulder; Crossing in Crosswalk Not at Intersection; NA; Not in Road; Approaching/Leaving School Bus

**vz_pcf_code (204+NA)** **\[California vehicle code primary collision factor violated\]**

**vz_pcf_description (159+NA) \[Description of vehicle code violated\]**

**oaf_viol_section (456+NA)** **\[Other associated factor section\]**

**number_killed (4)**: 0, 1, 2, 4

**number_injured (10)**: 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6, 10, 8

```{r}
#Checking unique values in each column that is relevant to movement of vehicles and severity of crash
unique(clean_traffic_data$collision_severity) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$move_pre_acc) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$type_of_collision) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$mviw) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$ped_action) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$vz_pcf_code) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$vz_pcf_description) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$oaf_viol_section) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$number_killed) 
unique(clean_traffic_data$number_injured)
